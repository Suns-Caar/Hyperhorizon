This is the Task 1 of the FTE Question Set 

The rest of the tasks are in different branches 


Tasks
Please use a custom build system like avr-gcc + Makefile that compiles the project
for an Arduino board of your choice. The project should be written in pure C at the
bare-metal level without using the Arduino library.
The task can be performed on the hardware or simulators like Wowki, TinkerCAD, etc.
The tasks will be evaluated based on performance, modularity, conciseness, and
clarity.
Your final submission should be a git repo with each task solution having its own
branch.
Task 1
Blink an LED on an Arduino board.
