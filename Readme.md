This Branch is for the Task 2 of the FTE Question Set 

Task 2
Write an 8-bit Fibonacci sequence counter. Display the output using an LED array.
Note
8-bit implies that the counter value should be an 8-bit number, and the counter
should loop back to 0 on exceeding the range.
Bonus
Explain how, for 32-bit numbers, you plan to scale this approach.

Arduino uno can be used to calculate 32 bit sequence as we can use an unsigned long int (uint32_t) datatype for the calculation.
